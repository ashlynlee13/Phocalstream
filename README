Basic Setup:
The project is missing an Azure configuration file which will need to be 
supplied containing the account connection information.  An example 
configuration file looks like: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceConfiguration serviceName="Phocalstream" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceConfiguration" osFamily="1" osVersion="*" schemaVersion="2012-05.1.7">
  <Role name="Phocalstream_Web">
    <Instances count="1" />
    <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[Account Name];AccountKey=[Account Key]" />
    </ConfigurationSettings>
  </Role>
</ServiceConfiguration>

The file path for the Azure config file should be 'Phocalstream/ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg'

In addition to the cloud service configuration, the Phocalstream_Web 
project is missing the Web.Release.config file.  This file will is 
required to build a release version of the project for deployment
and should contain the connection string for the remote SQL Server
instance.  See http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2010/10/26/asp-net-web-projects-web-debug-config-amp-web-release-config.aspx
for more details.
